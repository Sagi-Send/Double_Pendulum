# Double-Pendulum Simulation (MATLAB)

<p align="center">

</p>

A compact MATLAB project that **numerically solves** the nonlinear double-pendulum equations, **animates** the motion in real time, and **exports** the animation to an animated GIF.

## 📖 Theory
The double-pendulum is a classic example of a chaotic Hamiltonian system.
The system of coupled, second-order ODEs is derived via Lagrange’s equations for two point masses connected by massless rods.

## 🗂️ Repository layout

| File / folder | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| `Init.m` | Define physical parameters and initial conditions. |
| `Solver.m` | Integrates the equations of motion via `ode45`. |
| `Plotter.m` | Handles live animation, trajectory trace, and GIF export. |
| `main.m` | Orchestrates the entire simulation (calls *Init*, *Solver*, *Plotter*). |
| `Pendulum.asv`, `Plotter.asv` | Auto-save backups generated by MATLAB (can be ignored). |
| `figs/` | Output directory automatically created for exported GIFs. |
| `README.md` | You are here 👋 |
